1.) Create a directory for a new project. 
2.) Copy over the example config file to this directory and modify it according to need.
3.) Copy over the luigi-wrapper file as well.
4.) Download the sciluigi github repository
5.) Modify the luigi-wrapper PYTHONPATH to include the path to your sciluigi directory
6.) Set up your data in your data directory. Make sure to organize using the following structure:


output_directory/ <- Specified in config file. All pipeline outputs will go here
        |
        Data/     <- Will automatically check here
            | 
            experiment_id1/      
                |
                sample_id1
                    |
                    *.fastq.gz
                    *.fastq.gz
                sample_id2
                    |
                    *.fastq.gz
                    *.fastq.gz
                ...
            experiment_id2/
                |
                sample_id1
                    |
                    *.fastq.gz
                    *.fastq.gz
                sample_id2
                    |
                    *.fastq.gz
                    *.fastq.gz
                ...
                
7.) Create a file containing the sample names of interest IN THE SAME ORDER AS COLUMNS IN YOUR VCF. Specify the path to this in your config file.

8.) Once everything is set up and the config files up to date, its possible to start running the
portions of the pipeline.

    1.) To run WASP mapping run the following:
            bash luigi-wrapper WASP_alignment --experiment-id *experiment-id of interest*
    
    2.)
